# Welcome to Terranaut project

## Project info

**URL**: **[terranaut.earth](https://terranaut.earth/)**
Terranaut game generates synthetic satellite data by interpolating NASA SMAP, MODIS, and GPM observations with user-provided field data to create real-time farm simulation and decision support tools. It tackles satellite data gaps, enabling precision irrigation management through physics-based and AI-enhanced modeling.

**Key Features**
- Time-series interpolation respecting physical constraints
- Integration of user data with satellite estimates
- Real-time crop health and irrigation recommendations
- Dynamic plant visualization and harvest quality system

**Implementation**
- Data pre-downloaded for Catalonia region (Mar-Aug 2024)
- Linear interpolation as minimum viable product
- Physics-based evapotranspiration modeling
- User data calibration and synthetic data labeling
